A short example of encrypting and decrypting a JSON file with symmetric encryption, using OpenSSL.

To run this program, run:

```
python symmetric_enc.py
```

During runtime a new folder will be created, containing the results of the encryption/decryption and the chosen passphrase stored as a hash. Upon running the program again, these files will be removed automatically in preparation of new result files.
